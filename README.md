Artificial neural networks, usually simply called neural networks, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.


problem statement 
1 WE have Dataset which contains the details of 50 startup’s . Predicts the profit of a new Startup based on certain features. To Venture Capitalists this could be a boon as to whether they should invest in a particular Startup or not. So Build a Neural Network model to predict profit and which startup’s end up performing better. By seeing that if they spent more money on marketing or was it their stellar R&D department which led them to this huge profit and in turn huge fame and success.
