# Artificial-neural-network
Artificial neural networks, usually simply called neural networks, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.


problem statement :- 

1.) We have Dataset which contains the details of 50 startup’s . Predicts the profit of a new Startup based on certain features. To Venture Capitalists this could be a boon as to whether they should invest in a particular Startup or not. So Build a Neural Network model to predict profit and which startup’s end up performing better. By seeing that if they spent more money on marketing or was it their stellar R&D department which led them to this huge profit and in turn huge fame and success.

Problem Statement:-

2.)	We have Dataset listed 517 fires from the Montesano natural park in Portugal. For each incident, weekday, month, coordinates, and the burnt area are recorded, as well as several meteorological data such as rain, temperature, humidity, and wind. Predict the burned area of forest fires with Neural Networks. The model is then used to predict the burnt area based on the current date and the coordinates, where the fire is spotted. This prediction can be used for calculating the forces sent to the incident.
